# Unit-4-Game

Magical girl collector is a unit-4-game that consists of trying to get to the target score by clicking on the magical girls images, but if the player score goes over the target score then the game reset and the player loses, otherwise the player gets a win. Each magical girl has a different value which is unknown to the player and the value changes each time the game resets.
